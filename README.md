# ProviderSupport 1.0, an ASP.NET MVC app

This is an application I built while learning ASP.NET MVC. It is a web database app which allows a company to track its providers, clients, and the transactions in which providers serve clients. 

Some of its features:
- a database containing several joined tables
- a custom interface theme applied (Bootswatch)
- a custom input page - Transactions > Add New
- stats on the Home and About pages
